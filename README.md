wanted to make a brainF interpreter online so that i could tinker with it on my chromebook without wifi. runs most small examples but getting to larger projects with the program it starts to diverge in how it works compared to the real thing, due to the fact that i do not check for the cell being 0 at the start of a loop but rather the end.
