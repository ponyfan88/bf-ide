wanted to make a brainF interpreter online so that i could tinker with it on my chromebook. runs most small examples but getting to larger projects with the program it starts to diverge in how it works compared to the real thing. it all runs in an animationFrameLoop so it easily is able to display the current cell with colors. previous versions have identical operation without using a frame loop, so feel free to use those.
